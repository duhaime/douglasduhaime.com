Intertext identifies and visualizes instances of text reuse (imitation, adaptations, and plagiarisms) in large text collections. The algorithm used to identify text reuse minhashes all n-word windows from all input documents, allowing even consumer-grade hardware to efficiently identify text reuse with minimal RAM requirements.
