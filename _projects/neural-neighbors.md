Neural Neighbors allows users to browser visual tropes within 20,000 images from Yale University's Meserve-Kunhardt collection. This visualizer uses approximate nearest neighbors to cluster image vectors pulled from the penultimate layer of an Inception convolutional neural network trained on ImageNet 2012.
