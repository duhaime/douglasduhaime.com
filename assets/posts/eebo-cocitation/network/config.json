Each node (or colored dot) in this visualization represents a single text or author cited within the EEBO-TCP Corpus. Each edge (or line connecting two dots) represents the fact that the two connected nodes are both cited within at least one title within the corpus.\nThe color of each node is determined by that node\u0027s \"modularity class\"--i.e. the sub-network of nodes most commonly co-cited with the given node. The purple cluster contains literary figures; the red contains classical authors; the blue contains biblical and devotional works, and the yellow contains church fathers and other holy writers.\nIf you hover over one of the nodes, you can see the writer or text that node represents. If you then click on that node, you can see the authors and/or texts with which the given node is referenced in one or more titles within the EEBO-TCP corpus. \nBecause this graph represents a wide historical range of writers and works, those writers and works present in earlier centuries tend to be over-connected relative to more recent authors and works.\nThe current graph therefore favors lots of edges, in order to represent a maximally liberal interpretation of intertextuality within the EEBO-TCP corpus.\nThis graph is of course only one of many possible visualizations of the underlying data, both of which are compromised for reasons I have attempted to identify during my talk.",
