After a failed engagement, Bowles traveled in Europe beginning the series of sonnets that made him famous.  He was rector of Chicklade, Wiltshire (1792-97), Dubleton, Gloucestershire (1797), vicar of Bremhill, Wiltshire (1804-50), prebendary of Salisbury (1804), canon residentiary (1828).  Bowles's Sonnets made a deep impression on Coleridge while his criticisms of Pope was resented by Byron and Campbell.   \n", "works": ["Fourteen sonnets, elegiac and descriptive, written during a tour.  1789.", "Verses to John Howard, FRS.  1789.", "The grave of Howard:  a poem.  1790.", "Verses on the benevolent institution of the philanthropic society.  1790.", "A poetical address to Edmund Burke.  1791.", "Elegy written at the hot-wells, Bristol.  1791.", "Monody, written at Matlock.  1791.", "A sermon preached in the cathedral church of Sarum.  1795.", "Elegiac stanzas, written during sickness at Bath.  1796.", "Hope:  an allegorical sketch.  1796.", "St. Michael's Mount:  a poem.  1798.", "Coombe Ellen:  a poem.  1798.", "A discourse delivered to the military associations for the town and district of Shaftesbury.  1799.", "Song of the battle of the Nile.  1799.", "Poems.  1801.", "The sorrows of Switzerland:  a poem.  1801.", "Poems.
