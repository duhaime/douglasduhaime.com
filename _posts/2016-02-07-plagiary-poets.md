Last week I wrapped up [PlagiaryPoets.io][plagiary-poets], an interactive app that visualizes text reuse within early poetry:

<a href='http://plagiarypoets.io'>
  <img class='center-image large' src='/assets/posts/plagiary-poets/plagiary-poets.png' style='border:1px solid #ccc;'>
</a>

I was inspired to build the app after spending a month studying D3.js with [Bob Holt][bob-holt], [Mike Pennisi][mike-pennisi], and [Yannick Assogba][yannick-assogba], three brilliant developers who work for [Bocoup][bocoup]. The site was a lot of fun to build, and I look forward to launching related projects in the months to come. If you have any thoughts about this one, feel free to drop me a line below!
