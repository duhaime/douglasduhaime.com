When the Act of Anne established the first statute law on copyright in 1710, it neglected to discuss the legal status of works that derived from earlier publications. Translations, abridgements, and crafty plagiarisms all posed new questions on the acceptable uses of extant publications, and each became the center of intense legal deliberations in English courts. The judges who presided in these cases disambiguated a wide range of derivative literary forms, and offered influential rulings on the legal status of each. Historians have paid a great deal of attention to these cases, not least because they established the foundations of "fair use" policies in modern copyright law. While researchers have documented the ways these early copyright cases affected individual authors, however, there is little scholarship on the systematic ways in which rulings on derivative works affected the eighteenth-century book market. The study below attempts to fill this void by analyzing macroscopic trends in derivative literary forms across 200,000 works from the eighteenth-century English canon.

## Introduction

The 1710 Act of Anne granted publishers a statutory guarantee that they alone would be the sole legal publishers of works for which they had acquired the copyright. However, the statute did not clarify exactly what this right guarantees. In particular, the statute did not discuss the ways courts should treat works that derived from, but did not entirely replicate, a work under copyright. When eighteenth-century copyright owners discovered that others had adapted language and images from their artistic works, they therefore took to the courts to learn just what forms of artistic borrowing would be permitted under the new copyright law. In a series of highly-influential cases, English authors and publishers forced the courts to clarify the boundaries between legal and illegal uses of published print records. These cases&mdash;some of which we will detail below&mdash;ultimately defined a thin line that distinguished illicit thefts from agreeable adaptations.

Most researchers acknowledge these cases created the foundations of modern "fair use" law. There is little consensus, however, on the ways these rulings affected the production of derivative publications in the eighteenth century [[Sag 1373](#sag)]. In the case of literary abridgements&mdash;the most prominent form of derivative work from the period&mdash;for example, David Vaver argues that British publishers "frequently abridged one another's works" long after the 1710 Statute of Anne was enacted [[Vaver 225](#vaver)], while William St. Claire identifies "a clamp-down on abridgements" from 1600 until the 1774 <i>Donaldson v. Beckett</i> decision, after which year "a sudden flood" of derivative works flooded the market [[St. Claire 72](#st-claire)]. These scholarly disagreements are exacerbated by the fact that few have attempted systematic studies of derivative works and their relationship to eighteenth-century copyright law. Indeed, David Kunzle have observed "there is ... no study of artistic piracy in Europe" during the eighteenth century [[Kunzle 311](#kunzle)], and Isabella Alexander has noted that book historians lack a systematic study of textual abridgements during the period [[Alexander 1363](#alexander-a)].<sup><a href='#fn-1' id='ref-1'>1</a></sup> The present study attempts to fill this gap by studying trends in derivative publications within a corpus of 200,000 works published in eighteenth-century England.

## Derivative Texts after Gyles v. Wilcox

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, publishing was managed by the Stationer's Company, an institution incorporated in 1556 to help the English state control blasphemy and sedition within the printing industry. Only members of the Stationer's Company or individuals given special royal dispensation could become printers and legally publish works [[Holdsworth 843](#holdsworth)]. Authors who wished to publish a work sold their manuscript to these printers, who generally retained the right to copy the purchased work in perpetuity.

The English government supported this printing system by enacting a wide range of ordinances that explicitly forbade both complete and partial reprints of published works.<sup><a href='#fn-2' id='ref-2'>2</a></sup> Despite these restrictions, however, derivative works were evidently fairly common during the period. Even the preamble of the Statute of Anne laments that "Printers, Booksellers and other Persons have of late frequently taken the Liberty of printing, reprinting, and publishing ... Books and other Writings, without the Consent of the Authors and Proprietors ... to their very great Detriment" [[8 Anne, c. 19](#statute-of-anne)].<sup><a href='#fn-3' id='ref-3'>3</a></sup>

In order to prevent publishers from continuing to reprint extant works, the Act of Anne established a new copyright regime in England based on statutory law. Unfortunately, as legal historian Isabella Alexander observes, the Act "made no mention of those who might print or reprint only part of a book, or who might print it in a slightly altered form" [[Alexander 1362](#alexander-a)]. The few proposed bills that addressed partial reprinting were rejected, which meant case law would determine the precedent on which future rulings would depend [[Ginsburg 647](#ginsburg), [Alexander 1367](#alexander-a)].

The earliest cases on derivative literary works from the century&mdash;<i>Tonson v. Baker</i> (1710), <i>Gibbs v. Cole</i> (1734), <i>Austen v. Cave</i> (1739), <i>Hitch v. Langley</i> (1739), and <i>Read v. Hodges</i> (1740)&mdash;all ended with injunctions that prohibited the sale of the defendant's derivative work.<sup><a href='#fn-4' id='ref-4'>4</a></sup> The last of these, however, anticipated a changing attitude toward derivative works that would survive in English courts to the end of the century.

In 1739, James Read published a three-volume edition of John Motley's work <i>The History of the Life of Peter the First Emperor of Russia</i>. The following year, James Hodges abridged the work into a single volume published as <i>The Life and Reign of the Czar Peter the Great</i>. When Read sued for an injunction in <i>Read v. Hodges</i>, Hodges defended the legitimacy of his edition on four grounds; namely that his edition cost him great great time and money, this his edition was aimed at a "meaner" audience than Read's publication, that he varied every passage he copied from Read's edition, and that Read's edition itself contained 108 pages copied with little variation from Friedrich Weber's 1722 work, <i>The Present State of Russia</i> [[Deazley 82-3](#deazley-c)]. Hodges's argument was initially effective, as the chief presiding judge Lord Hardwicke dissolved the preliminary injunction against Hodges. Later the same day, however, Hardwicke heard additional arguments from both sides and reinstated the injunction, which remained in place at trial's end [[Deazley 796](#deazley-a), [Alexander 1373](#alexander-a)].

Lord Hardwicke's wavering position in <i>Read v. Hodges</i> anticipates the watershed decision he would deliver the following year while presiding over the landmark <i>Gyles v. Wilcox</i>. The case arose when John Wilcox hired an author to abridge <i>The History of the Pleas of the Crown</i>, a work published by English bookseller Fletcher Gyles in 1736. Gyles sued for an injunction, but Wilcox's abridgement was recognized as a distinct copyrightable work and Gyles was ultimately denied injunctive relief. In his official ruling in <i>Gyles v. Wilcox</i>, Lord Hardwicke famously argued: "Where books are colourably shortened only, they are undoubtedly within the meaning of the act of Parliament, and ... a mere evasion of the statute, and cannot be called an abridgement. But this must not be carried so far as to restrain persons from making a real and fair abridgement, for abridgements may with great propriety be called a new book, because not only the paper and print, but the invention, learning, and judgment of the author is shewn in them, and in many cases are extremely useful" [[26 English Reports 490](#english-reports)].<sup><a href='#fn-5' id='ref-5'>5</a></sup> Often cited as the foundation of future fair use decisions, Hardwicke's argument in <i>Gyles v. Wilcox</i> ushered in a new era in English copyright law, one in which authors and publishers could consistently defend the legality of derivative publications.

If derivative works before <i>Fletcher v. Gyles</i> were consistenly denied legal standing, those afterwards were consistenly granted legal standing. Following the Gyles decision, a string of influential cases&mdash;including <i>Cogan v. Cave</i> (1743), <i>Dodsley v. Kinnersley</i> (1761), <i>Strahan v. Newberry</i> (1774), <i>Sayer v. Moore</i> (1785), <i>Carnan v. Bowles</i> (1786), <i>Harrison v. Hogg</i> (1794), <i>Cary v. Longman and Rees</i> (1801), <i>Wilkins v. Aikin</i> (1810), and <i>Whittingham v. Wooler</i> (1817)&mdash;all rejected the plaintiff's petition for an injunction against a partially derivative work. As the legal historian Simon Stern has noted, English courts continued to recognize derivative publications as distinct, copyrightable works until well into the nineteenth century [[Stern 11](#stern)].

While scholars have recognized that <i>Gyles v. Wilcox</i> introduced a "fair use" interpretation of derivative works into English copyright law, they have disagreed about the ways this shift affected artistic practices during the period. Some researchers, such as the prominent legal historian Ronan Deazley, have argued that judges who recognized derivative works as distinct, copyrightable works after <i>Gyles v. Wilcox</i> encouraged a "proliferation of review articles, literary 'epitomes', abridgements, and 'detached episodes'" [[Deazley 4](#deazley-b)]. Others, such as William St. Claire, argue instead that "literary anthologies and abridgements suddenly disappeared in 1600 and [were] suddenly revived in 1774" following the <i>Donaldson v. Beckett</i> ruling [[St. Claire 80](#st-claire)]. Hitherto, however, researchers have lacked corpus-driven evidence with which to evaluate these competing histories of imitative publications. The following section outlines the methods used in the present study to provide a computational analysis of trends in derivative works across the eighteenth century.

## Identifying Derivative Texts: Data and Methods

The study below used the Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO) databases I and II, a set of 182,765 titles published between 1700 and 1800. ECCO is the largest digital collection of eighteenth-century records available, but as Patrick Spedding has noted, "ECCO's 32 million pages of text are not a completely representative sample of eighteenth-century publishing" [[Spedding 437](#spedding)]. ECCO in fact contains only roughly 60% the eighteenth-century titles in the English Short Title Catalogue&mdash;the most authoritative list of titles published in England and English speaking countries from 1473-1800<sup><a href='#fn-7' id='ref-7'>7</a></sup>&mdash;though the annual titles in ECCO are strongly correlated with those in the ESTC:

<img src='{{ image_dir }}/ecco-estc-coverage.png' />

Two aspects of the ECCO dataset had particularly strong influence on the methods used to identify text reuse in the present study.<sup><a href='#fn-8' id='ref-8'>8</a></sup> The most influential aspect of this dataset was the size of the corpus. The text dataset on which the analysis below was run contains 182,765 titles with more than 32 million pages of text. To compare each of these titles to each other text would mean making 16,701,431,230 comparisons.<sup><a href='#fn-9' id='ref-9'>9</a></sup> If each comparison took one second, the computation would take over 500 years to complete. To make the computation faster, the present study uses a method detailed below to transform each document into a set of signatures, where each signature represents the semantic content of a small portion of a document. Using this siganture-based approach allowed a supercomputer to compare each document to each other document in roughly one month's time.

The second major factor in the method selection was the poor text quality of the input documents. The ECCO database is especially prone to rough OCR output, as the books were photographed at scale many years ago with poorer camera technologies, and contain non-standard spellings, outdated font styles, and forgotten characters like the long ∫&mdash;all of which confounded the OCR model:

<img src='{{ image_dir }}/ecco-ocr-quality.jpg' />

To discover text reuse in this large corpus with non-standardized spelling and poor OCR, I implemented the following workflow. First, each sequence of 14 consecutive words was identified in each document, and every fourth window was retained for analysis. All unique three-character sequences were extracted from each of those windows, and those character sequences were used to build a set of 256 hashes that represented the semantic content of the given window.<sup><a href='#fn-10' id='ref-10'>10</a></sup> All text windows that shared a sequence of four consecutive hash values were then compared for similarity using a variant of the Ratcliff/Obershelp algorithm, and matches were recorded in a database for subsequent analysis.

## Hogarth's Act and Eighteenth-Century Copyright in Images

While printed materials acquired statutory protection in the Statute of Anne (1710), engravings, prints, and other visual art did not gain statutory protection until the enactment of Hogarth's Act (1735). Often identified as the second major piece of British copyright law, Hogarth's Act was the result of a series of petitions organized by William Hogarth and other engravers, who believed visual artists and designers deserved the same copyright protections authors acquired in the Statute of Anne.

In his quest for visual copyright protections, Hogarth organized a formal petition to the House of Commons, where he lamented the fact that "divers Printsellers, Printers, and other Persons, both here and abroad, have, of late, too frequently taken the Liberty of copying, printing, and publishing, great Quantities of base, imperfect, and mean, Copies and Imitations thereof; to the great Detriment of the Petitioners, and other such Artists, and to the Discouragement of Arts and Sciences in this Kingdom" [[364](#house-of-commons-journals)]. Hogarth's plea for copyright protection of visual art was granted in the 1735 "Act for the Encouragement of the Arts of Designing, Engraving, and Etching" (8 Geo. II, c. 13), often referred to as Hogarth's Act. This Act provided a 14 year, fixed-term copyright protection for new visual artworks, though the 1766 Engraving Copyright Act (7 Geo. III, c. 38) doubled the term of protection to 28 years [[108](#shortt)].<sup><a href='#fn-6' id='ref-6'>6</a></sup>

In 1739, <i>Hitch v. Langley</i> became one of the first image copyright cases under the new statute. The case's plaintiff, Charles Hitch, was a member of the London Conger&mdash;the small and elite group of wealthy publishers that ruled the English book market&mdash;who had acquired the copyright for James Gibbs' <i>Book of Architecture</i> (1728) and <i>Rules for Drawing the Several Parts of Architecture</i> (1732). Hitch demonstrated that the defendant Batty Langley had "printed coppyed published and sold great parts of the said books" without authority, including fourteen prints from Gibbs' works, and was granted an injunction preventing Langley from reprinting his work or any part thereof [[Deazley 80](#deazley-c), [Alexander 1370](#alexander-a)].

While several early cases on derivative prints ended with similar injunctions, <i>Sayer v. Moore</i> (1785) recognized the defendant's derivative prints as distinct copyrightable works, establshing a watershed precendent for fair use rulings in the visual arts. <i>Sayer v. Moore</i> revolved around sea charts the defendant, sailor and maritime publisher John Hamilton Moore, included in his <i>New and Correct Chart of North America</i> [[Skelton 208](#skelton)]. The plaintiff, Robert Sayer, alleged Moore pirated these charts from works for which he held the copyright, and therefore intended to sue for an injunction and £10,000 in damages. During the trial, an engraver hired to produce Moore's charts confessed "he was actually employed by the defendant to take a draft of the Gulph Passage (in the West Indies) from the plaintiffs' map" [[Monthly Review 48](#monthly-review)]. Later in the trial, however, several witnesses testified that Moore's maps made a great number of improvements upon Sayer's, and were far less dangerous to mariners by virtue of these improvements. These improvements would have a significant effect on the ultimate verdict and the future of English copyright law.

Lord Mansfield, the lead judge in <i>Sayer v. Moore</i>, recognized the importance of the case's outcome. In his official remarks on the case, Mansfield noted: "The rule of decision in this case is a matter of great consequence to the country. In deciding it we must take care to guard against two extremes equally prejudicial; the one, that men of ability, who have employed their time for the service of the community, may not be deprived of their just merits, and the reward of their ingenuity and labour; the other, that the world may not be deprived of improvements, nor the progress of the arts retarded" [[49](#monthly-review)]. When striking this delicate balance in the case of publications based on facts, Mansfield continues, one should not punish works for their similitude to antecedants, as doing so would prevent historians and lexicographers from describing the same events and words that were described in earlier works. To find a defendant guilty of infringing another's copyright, Mansfield concludes, "there must be such a similitude as to make it probable and reasonable to suppose that one is a transcript of the other, and nothing more than a transcript" [[49](#monthly-review)]. Because Moore's maps considerably improved Sayer's, and were therefore more than a mere "transcript" of the plaintiff's work, the jury dissolved Sayer's injunction and found in favor of Moore.

Just as <i>Gyles v. Wilcox</i> had established a precedent for fair use rulings in derivative texts, <i>Sayer v. Moore</i> created a precedent for fair use rulings in derivative images. Following <i>Sayer v. Moore</i>, a number of cases&mdash;including <i>Steel v. Moore</i> (1789), <i>Harrison v. Hogg</i> (1794), and <i>Wilkins v. Aikin</i> (1810)&mdash;observed the fair use precedent and recognized derivative images as distinct, copyrightable works. While scholars now recognize the court's increased tolerance for derivative images in the final decades of the eighteenth-century, however, little is known about the ways these fair use rulings affected the production or distribution of visual imagery during the period. The following section described the methods used in the present study to pursue this question.

## Identifying Derivative Images: Data and Methods

Image data for the analysis below was collected from Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO). The ECCO database contains photographs of each page in 182,765 titles published from roughly 1700-1800. Gale Cengage identified the subset of page photographs that contain images, which allowed a simple algorithm to collect the images.

## Notes

<span id='fn-1'>1. William St. Claire has also called attention to the paucity of numerical data on the ways in which changes in eighteenth-century legal cultures impacted the book market: "I am not aware," he writes, "of any published quantitative or economic analysis of the effects of the changing intellectual property regine on texts, prices, access, and readerships" [[42](#st-claire)]. [↩](#ref-1)</span>

<span id='fn-2'>2. A number of prohibitions against partial reprinting were passed before the 1710 Statute of Anne. In 1637, the Star Chamber granted protections for "books, ballads, charts, portraiture, or any other thing or thing" and prohibited the copying of "name, title, mark or vinnet" from these protected works [[Kunzle 311](#kunzle)]. In 1643 Parliament ordered that "no Book, Pamphlet nor Paper, <i>nor part of such Book, Pamphlet or Paper</i>" be printed without being first licensed and registered with the Company of Stationers [[Slauter 36](#slauter), [Stern 5](#stern)]. In 1678 the Stationer's Company again forbade the reprinting of "any part of any Book" without consent of the book's author, and in 1681 the Stationer's Company  strengthened this prohibition against partial reprintings in another ordinance [[Alexander 1362](#alexander-a), [Alexander 161](#alexander-d)].</span>

Despite these early prohibitions against derivative works, the government enforced a rather inconsistent set of regulations of reprints during the period. In 1621, for example, Helen Mason was granted a royal license to abridge Foxe's <i>Book of Martyrs</i> [[Deazley 799](#deazley-a)], while ten years later Robert Young was denied a license to abridge the same work [[Alexander 1364](#alexander-a)]. [↩](#ref-2)

<span id='fn-3'>3. Citations of English statutes enacted before 1962 report the name of the sovereign, their "regnal years" (years as monarch), and "chapter number" (1-based index position of the act in the parliamentary session for the given regnal year). Thus 8 Anne, c. 19 refers to the 19th act passed in the parliamentary session held during the 8th year of Queen Anne's rule (1710). For more information on statutory citations, see [[Bluebook 274](#blue-book)].</span> [↩](#ref-3)

<span id='fn-4'>4. Most of the legal battles over copyright infringement from the period were fought in the Court of Chancery, and most followed a fairly predictable narrative. Generally a plaintiff would allege that their copyright had been infringed or was soon to be infringed upon by a derivative work. If their allegations seemed worthy of inspection, an injunction was immediately granted to prohibit the defendant from printing or vending the work in question [[34 English Reports 886](#english-reports)]. This injuction remained in place until the case came to hearing, at which point the defendant could attempt to convince the court that they had not infringed upon the plaintiff's rights. In many cases, the preliminary injunction created at the outset of the case was enough to stop a pirate, who could not afford the time and money required to fight a proper legal battle [[Bald 89](#bald)].</span>

Among the pre-1741 cases that did proceed to trial, there were of course a number of examples that are not detailed above&mdash;including <i>Saunders v. Tonson</i> (1690), <i>Burnet v. Chetwood</i> (1721), <i>Knaplock v. Curll</i> (1722), <i>Tonson v. Clifton</i> (1722), <i>Gay v. Read</i> (1729), <i>Gilliver v. Watson</i> (1729), <i>Motte v. Walker</i> (1735), <i>Baller v. Watson</i> (1737), and <i>Eyre v. Walker</i> (1737)&mdash;but these hinged on issues other than partial reprintings of protected works. [↩](#ref-4)

<span id='fn-5'>5. Citations of eighteenth-century legal cases often appear in one of two forms. Some legal citations, such as those in H. Tomas Gomez-Arostegui's [database of early English copyright cases](https://law.lclark.edu/live/files/18027-copyright-suit-database), cite the organizational schema of the relevant archival materials within the English National Archives. For example, Gomez-Arostegui's citation for the first court proceedings in the <i>Gyles v. Beckett</i> case, C11/1828/27, m. 1, refers to the 27th entry within the 1828 record group [Pleadings] within the C11 record division [Court of Chancery]. Using this schema, one can examine the [relevant document](http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C10515980) in the National Archives.</span>

Those without direct access to the National Archives often cite the English Reports, a 178 volume printing that contains the facts and relevant procedural information from the majority of legal cases tried between 1220 and 1866 in England. The citation above, 26 English Reports 490, refers to the 490th page of the 26th volume of the English Reports, which one can access using the physical English Reports volumes or HeinOnline's digital scans of the same. [↩](#ref-5)

<span id='fn-6'>6. There were some ad-hoc prohibitions against reprinting visual materials before the enactment of Hogarth's Act (1735). In the age when monarchs granted royal monopolies for particular genres of printing, Charles II granted John Seller letters patent that "prohibit[s] and forbid[s] all our Subjects ... to Copy, Epitomize, or Reprint the said Treatises of Navigation ... In whole or in part ... or to Copy or Counterfeit any of the Maps, Plats or Charts that shall be in the said Treatises, within the them of Thirty years" unless Seller found the derivative work agreeable [[Alexander 9](#alexander-c)]. Such bespoke provisions were the exception rather than the rule; the majority of artists and printers remained vulnerable due to the lack of statutory protection for visual artworks. When Jacob Tonson Sr. reprinted engravings from John Baker's edition of <i>Hudibras</i> (1710) in his own edition of the same work in the same year, for exmample, he was only publicly shamed, not legally charged, for the theft [[Gomez-Arostegui 1265](#gomez-arostegui)]. [↩](#ref-6)</span>

<span id='fn-7'>7. While the English Short Title Catalogue is the best bibliographical foundation against which to measure coverage of early modern publications, Michael F. Suarez, S.J. concluded after a thorough study of the database that "as much as 10 per cent of the printed record from 1701-1800 ha[d] not been incorporated into the <i>ESTC</i>" as of 2004. Over ten thousand eighteenth century records have since been added to the ESTC, though I am unaware of updated estimates of the ESTC's coverage of the period [[Suarez 40](#suarez)]. [↩](#ref-7)</span>

<span id='fn-8'>8. Automatic discovery of reused text is a major field of research in engineering journals, and there are many papers on the subject. For excellent overviews of relatively recent methods, see Alzahrani 2012 and Wang 2014. For recent papers in the Digital Humanities that leverage automatic discovery of text reuse, see Bamman 2009, Mews 2010, Roe 2012, Smith 2013, Forstall 2014, and Ganascia 2014. [↩](#ref-8)</span>

<span id='fn-9'>9. Because detecting text reuse within a corpus requires us to compare each of the N corpus texts against each of the other N corpus texts, thus making N x N comparisons, engineers would say they this problem has worst-case algorithmic complexity O(N<sup>2</sup>). Technically, once we compare text A to text B, we don't need to compare text B to text A, which reduces the complexity to O(<span class='fraction'><span>N<sup>2</sup></span><span class='bar'>/</span><span class='bottom'>2</span></span>). Furthermore, we don't need to compare a text to itself, which further reduces the complexity to O(<span class='fraction'><span>N<sup>2</sup></span><span class='bar'>/</span><span class='bottom'>2</span></span> - N). Engineers nevertheless generally refer to this task as an "N-squared problem". [↩](#ref-9)</span>

<span id='fn-10'>10. These hashes were generated using the "minhash" technique introduced by Andrei Broder and documented in <i>Mining of Massive Datasets</i>, 3.3-3.4. All character trigram sets were hashed using the same set of 256 permutation functions, which allowed the processing to be massively parallelized. These minhash signatures collectively provide a "localitive sensitive hash" of each passage, such that the probability of two passages generating the same hash sequence is proportional to the similarity between those passages.
